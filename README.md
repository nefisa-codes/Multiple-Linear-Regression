# Multiple-Linear-Regression

Project: Hospital Charge Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression
This project investigates the key factors influencing total hospital charges by performing a comprehensive multiple linear regression analysis on a dataset of 10,000 patient records.

Key Steps & Outcomes:

Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed data by handling outliers with the Z-score method and encoding categorical variables.

Model Development: Built and refined an initial model by removing statistically insignificant variables (p-value > 0.05), resulting in a streamlined, high-performing model.

Results: The final model explained 73% of the variance in total charges (R² = 0.732). Key drivers identified include patient readmission, chronic conditions (like arthritis, diabetes, anxiety), and the type of initial administration.

Actionable Insights: The analysis provides data-driven recommendations for healthcare administrators to manage costs, such as focusing on reducing readmission rates and supporting programs for chronic disease management.

Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
